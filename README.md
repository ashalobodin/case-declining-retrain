# Case Declining Model Re-training
The script is for re-training the model that declines ukrainian names.

The project is to help re-train the already trained model that is used in SPSUkraineAssistant lambda, see https://github.com/SPSCommerce/SPSUkraineAssistant for details.

Re-training is necessary for the cases when the model fails to predict a genitive case.
